Subject: [PATCH] [media] media: adv7180: increase delay after reset to 5ms

Initialization of the ADV7180 chip fails on the Renesas R8A7790-based
Lager board about 50% of the time.  This patch resolves the issue by
increasing the minimum delay after reset from 2 ms to 5 ms, following the
recommendation in the ADV7180 datasheet:

"Executing a software reset takes approximately 2 ms. However, it is
recommended to wait 5 ms before any further I2C writes are performed."
